# lfrp
Lfrp is light fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. 

It's just a backup of frp, when Win10/Win11 intercept frp (so I can't connect to my work virtual machine without administrator privileges during meetings).

Otherwiseï¼Œ this is so simple that it's easy to use for students to learn.
